# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This textbook represents the cutting edge of embodied artificial intelligence, where digital intelligence meets physical reality through advanced humanoid robotic systems.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a revolutionary approach that combines traditional AI with physical systems. Unlike conventional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI is embodied—it exists and operates in the physical world, interacting with objects, environments, and humans through robotic platforms.

### The Physical AI Trinity

Physical AI consists of three interconnected components:

1. **Perception**: Understanding the physical world through sensors
2. **Cognition**: Processing information and making intelligent decisions
3. **Action**: Executing physical movements and manipulations
