# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers physics simulation and environment modeling using Gazebo and Unity.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up Gazebo simulation environments
- Understand physics simulation concepts (gravity, collisions, rigid body dynamics)
- Work with both URDF and SDF formats
- Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Integrate Unity for high-fidelity visualization

## Topics
- Gazebo simulation setup
- Physics simulation (gravity, collisions, rigid body dynamics)
- URDF vs SDF formats
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction
